          <div>Luckily the same guy!</div>

          <div>Have you any programming or web design experience?</div>
          <div>Only a tiny bit of html/js/php and what I have picked up studying with RMIT. I love Java, having learnt it 
            early on and have found Javascript easy to understand (thanks to Java) having picked it up while working with 
            NodeRed within the BITS course. Further to this I have fumbled my way through some C and C++ while programming 
            Arduino gizmos for the same BITS project.    </div>

          <div>Do you see yourself as a programmer or designer, or both?</div>
          <div>I would argue the two are one in the same. The art of programming to me seems analog in nature in the way that 
            there are a million different ways to build any system and&#8212like designing&#8212equal amounts of logic and 
            creativity are required to achieve the desired goal with the target audience.</div>

          <div>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</div>
          <div>I wont lie, I'm here as this is a core course for the bachelor of IT. I will however add to this by saying this 
            is one of the courses I have been looking forward to doing! Since dabbling in html I have appreciated how powerful 
            a skill set web development is and can see that it's uses go far beyond the internet.</div>

          <div>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</div>
          <div>Fluent understanding of the how-to's and not-to's of web development and the skill set to produce the projects 
            of my wildest dreams!</div>

          <div>What websites do you use the most? (NB: "family friendly" !)</div>
          <div>I think the RMIT portal is an obvious one as all I do at home nowadays is uni. Aside from this and general 
            question-answering sites like W3 and Stack overflow, the Google suite of online applications is basically where I 
            live either at home or work. I will give an honorable mention to Facebook as being my least visited site.</div>

          <div>Do you have any interests or hobbies?</div>
          <div>Aside from trying to kill myself with full-time uni and work, my hobbies include playing music as can be seen 
            <a href="#dp">in my display picture</a> I am also a seasoned kung fu practitioner and teacher, specialising in the 
              southern praying mantis style of fighting. Various other hobbies include archery, drone flying/building and 
              photography.</div>

        <p>In this space you are asked to compose a website analysis and redevelopment proposal for the website found at this location:<br><a href='https://www.sites.google.com/site/anzacdouglasraymondbaker' target='_blank'>ANZAC Douglas Raymond Baker - Letters Home</a></p>
        <br>
        <p>Dear Ian,
          <br>
          <br>Thank you for allowing the opportunity to provide feedback regarding your webpage ‘Letters Home’. Following is an analysis of the page as you have requested which details—at a high level—the proposal for redesign.
          
          <p>Styling;
          <br><br>
          Overall, the work you have done in building the page is excellent, providing a very detailed peek into the life of this amazing war hero in hopes that this legacy be not forgotten. As you have stated within the introduction, the letters allow a younger demographic to connect with this important history and as such, the page’s styling should be targeted at appealing to a younger audience which unfortunately it currently does not do. The colour scheme, although suitable for the era and genre, could be tweaked to portray a more solemn emotion, invoking echoes of the past similar to that of a memorial. Note the original wood-grain background pattern that you used was great at making the page content pop. Similar to this, matching the colour tones in the picture of Douglas and darkening the background would assist in highlighting the subject and text. Furthermore, if the colour palette was based around the picture, it would provide continuity of styling, blending everything together. For context visualise the difference between a picture on a fridge versus a photo in a carefully chosen frame. Further to this colour scheme, we could incorporate a darkened background image relating to the war with a soft blurring, having the menus appear like floating frosted glass promoting a crisp clean and modern appearance while still holding true to the content.
          <p>Structure;
          <br><br>
          As mentioned, the page is fantastic and I wish not to detract from the effort you have put into its creation however I believe modifying the structure and layout of the site will help to maximise its effectiveness. As we have learnt through human-computer interface studies, Simplicity is key and every click a user makes should be purposeful and necessary, otherwise the click should not be required. Keeping this in mind and understanding that mobile devices are becoming more popular for browsing the internet, we could implement a downward scrolling layout which would remove the navigation menu and provide seamless transitions between blocks of information. This can help reduce the amount of pages a user must navigate between and in turn, reduce confusion and prevent people from getting lost in the extensive information within the page. Building on this idea, tabs at the top of the page underneath the title header would list the years in which the letters are divided by, and be visible at all times while scrolling down to allow the user intuitive navigation throughout the site. Furthermore, the letters could be list thumbnails similar to what you have done, but displayed as an ‘accordion’ style list, only expanding letters when clicked. This will allow the user to see what comes directly before and after each letter while maintaining ease of navigation where switching to a new page for each letter is not required. Additionally I would like to suggest the implementation of a geographical map, marking the locations that Douglas visited while at war effectively building on the ‘places’ page you have included. This would provide a much more detailed and interactive experience for the user and allow the inclusion of information that Douglas does not include in his letters. Location points on the map can be interactive, providing more information when clicked and even include hyperlinks to relevant letters within the site or even external information regarding the war.
          <p>Content;
          <br><br>
          The trend we see with the modern age of internet browsing reveals that people have very little attention span and are easily lost if a web page does not grab their interest within the first few seconds. As previously mentioned, the content of Letters Home is very moving however I fear that many may lose interest upon first glance of the verbose home and introduction sections. Although it might seem necessary to give an introduction, I believe a more effective approach would be to just let Douglas speak for himself. When writing a narrative, authors must be careful not to spoon feed too much information to the reader but rather encourage people’s inquisition and desire to figure things out themselves. Similarly we could harness this idea to draw people in by including short interesting excerpts from the letters at the top of the page. These very short quotes would change from one to the other over time and act as a kind of teaser, invoking people’s intrigue and hopefully moving them to want to find out more. Text within the page can also be made interactive allowing for uncommon words and abbreviations to be clickable to offer a description or more information. Other content that is not imperative to keeping a users attention should be moved to the footer, contact link, or an ‘About’ tab, keeping it present and accessible but not key to the experience offered.
          <p>Framework;
          <br><br>
          Finally, if we were to include the aforementioned modifications, it would be wise to update the page’s backend to HTML5 compatible. While this might appear to be an additional costly and unnecessary requirement, a complete rewrite to HTML5 in most cases can be quicker than modifying antiquated code. Furthermore, the limitations of older HTML often require workarounds to implement modernised styles and features which greatly adds to the time and cost of development. Currently we can see scaling issues related to this within the current page that result in losing the title off screen and also it being blocked by the search form. Also If we are to use HTML5, future modifications—when required—can be done very quickly and cost effectively. As mentioned previously in relation to style, moving to a more mobile friendly design would be very much enhanced through the use of HTML5 as it provides extensive features and support for a very wide range of devices and web browsers. Lastly HTML5 allows for embedding of audio and video, requiring no plugin to be installed which offers a more immersive experience and allows audio and video to make up part of the main title display if desired. HTML5 also offers seamless integration with JavaScript providing much more flexibility for user interface, as an example, with inclusion of animated transitions.
          <p>Thanks again for your time Ian,
          <br>I really look forward to working with you!
            
          <p>Regards,
          <br>Nathan</p>
