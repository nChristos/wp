          <div>Who is your tutor / instructor</div>
          <div>The great Trevor Reynolds!</div>

          <div>Who is your labber / workshopper</div>
          <div>Luckily the same guy!</div>

          <div>Have you any programming or web design experience?</div>
          <div>Only a tiny bit of html/js/php and what I have picked up studying with RMIT. I love Java, having learnt it 
            early on and have found Javascript easy to understand (thanks to Java) having picked it up while working with 
            NodeRed within the BITS course. Further to this I have fumbled my way through some C and C++ while programming 
            Arduino gizmos for the same BITS project.    </div>

          <div>Do you see yourself as a programmer or designer, or both?</div>
          <div>I would argue the two are one in the same. The art of programming to me seems analog in nature in the way that 
            there are a million different ways to build any system and&#8212like designing&#8212equal amounts of logic and 
            creativity are required to achieve the desired goal with the target audience.</div>

          <div>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</div>
          <div>I wont lie, I'm here as this is a core course for the bachelor of IT. I will however add to this by saying this 
            is one of the courses I have been looking forward to doing! Since dabbling in html I have appreciated how powerful 
            a skill set web development is and can see that it's uses go far beyond the internet.</div>

          <div>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</div>
          <div>Fluent understanding of the how-to's and not-to's of web development and the skill set to produce the projects 
            of my wildest dreams!</div>

          <div>What websites do you use the most? (NB: "family friendly" !)</div>
          <div>I think the RMIT portal is an obvious one as all I do at home nowadays is uni. Aside from this and general 
            question-answering sites like W3 and Stack overflow, the Google suite of online applications is basically where I 
            live either at home or work. I will give an honorable mention to Facebook as being my least visited site.</div>

          <div>Do you have any interests or hobbies?</div>
          <div>Aside from trying to kill myself with full-time uni and work, my hobbies include playing music as can be seen 
            <a href="#dp">in my display picture</a> I am also a seasoned kung fu practitioner and teacher, specialising in the 
              southern praying mantis style of fighting. Various other hobbies include archery, drone flying/building and 
              photography.</div>
