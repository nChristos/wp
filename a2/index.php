          <h1>The Great War as seen through the eyes of ANZAC Douglas Raymond Baker.</h1>
          <br><br>
          <p>These are copies of letters written by my father Douglas Raymond Baker who I share names with, during his service throughout the First World War (1914-1918). I have three thick exercise books in which the letters were copied in hand writing by my Aunt Alice, his sister. I understand that this was done so his letters could be sent on to other members of the family. I don’t know if the originals are still in existence, probably not.

            Just have a chance to write a few lines at a small shop near the Camp. We had about four hours in Brisbane before going to Camp and had a good look round. Arrived in Camp about 6 p.m. and all the Gympie lads [Infantry] were placed in one tent [11 of us].  The Light Horse are nearly a mile from us. Of course it was my luck to be made Tent Orderly for the first day – getting the tucker and cleaning up. We have had nothing issued to us yet, so just as well I brought something.  There is no child’s play in this camp – plenty of hard work – they mean business. We have a free hand at night so far and can write as we like.  Saw Herb as we were marching to the Camp. He was going back from work and I had only time to shake hands with him – could not leave the ranks. We will be under Captain Jackson. He has been appointed Captain of the Northern Rivers men and managed to get us in with him. Cannot write any more, am in a hurry. Will write more later on. Am feeling quite homesick. Had our feet examined today, teeth tomorrow I think.

              We are doing plenty of hard work, the officers here think we will be sent straight into the firing line when we get there and the men all seem eager for it. Taking things altogether the life here is not too bad. All the Gympie fellows are very decent and we stick together. Today we were issued with new rifles and bayonets, etc. but so far no uniform.  My regimental number is 692 but you need not put that in the address of any letters. We were advised to let our people know our number in case  - - - -. Yesterday about 150,000 rounds of ball cartridges arrived, we will have to go through a stiff shooting test. Our feet are examined every day. We sit in a long row with bare feet sticking out. I will have to dress for parade now so hooray with best love from Ray.

            On Saturday when we came into camp from drill at 12 o’clock, we were told that the Commandant was very pleased with the progress made and had granted us a half holiday so the Gympie lads decided to go to the city. We had a good time in Brisbane and had tea at a fish shop.  Met Herb at about 7 p.m. and we all went to the Empire but the show was very poor. We have had issued to us two towels, two pairs under-pants, two singlets, two pairs socks, a sweater and a cake of soap. I think we will get boots in a day or two and other things. A church parade was held but none of the Gympie lads attended. It happened to be a voluntary one! We are all keeping in pretty good health and hope you all are at home. Today is payday, we are to get paid every fortnight, this time we will get 11 days. I am only drawing half of mine and banking the rest. Love to all.

          <article class="letter">
            <p>
            Pens are being driven at top speed in all directions for we have received word that letters will not be censored, so everyone is writing to catch the mail that is to be put ashore at Aden tomorrow or Tuesday. I have kept a few notes since leaving Albany so will start from that part of our voyage and tell you all the news.  Of course I wrote to you from Albany and also from Colombo and hope you received my letters and cards alright. 
            On October 31st we moved into the wharf at Albany from the bay to get water and provisions.  We passed a large cruiser [The Minatour] and she looked bosker.  The H.M.A.S. Melbourne was also near.  The troopship “Pera” was drawn up on the opposite side of the wharf to us and seemed to be manned chiefly by Lascars who seemed a dirty crowd.  At 2.30 p.m. we were taken ashore for a march to stretch our legs.  It was a grand outing and we went in fatigue dress, without rifles, around the hills of Albany and returned to the Omrah much refreshed.  This was our second trip ashore.  We left the Albany wharf just as the sun was setting and the town looked very pretty with the fine stretch of water in front and great green hills behind, with huge boulders sticking out here and there.  The sunset was really beautiful; altogether our last view of Albany was all that could be desired.  When passing the cruisers we were all lined up on deck to salute them and they dipped their flag in return.  We anchored in the bay for a night.
            At 6.30 a.m. the first of the fleet was on the move and by 10 a.m. all the troopships were out and another stage of the journey commenced.  It was a great sight and one to be long remembered, to see the boats steaming out one after the other in a long line and as they got into the open each took up its allotted position.  We sailed in three lines, the Omrah being near the rear on the right flank.  There were 38 troopships left Albany including ten from New Zealand.  Some of the boats are very slow travellers and we had to go slow too, about 10 miles an hour.  On Tuesday, after leaving Albany, sports were held on board but the weather interfered with them, being rainy and windy, besides, they were badly organized.  There is a sing-song being held on deck under the leadership of the Y.M.C.A. so as I want a smoke I will proceed to go on deck and kill two birds with one stone.
            Later:-  The sing-song is a frost so I have come to the opposite side of the saloon-deck to resume this letter.  Some of the events of the sports were:- obstacle race, potato race, single stick fighting, step dance, laughing competition, best dressed clown and many others.
            On Friday, Nov. 6th, the “Osterley” passed us on her way to England, she was only a few hundred yards away from us and the passengers were lined up waving and cheering.  It would be a great sight for them to see such a large fleet of ships so close together in mid-ocean and guarded by cruisers.  That night a concert was held on board and was very good.  The orchestra consisted of piano, violin, cornet and clarinet.  Colonel Merrington sang “The Deathless Army”,  the Y.M.C.A. chap sang “Long Live the King”.   One chap gave an Australian war-cry, which nearly brought down the house.  There were many other songs and recitations.
            Did I tell you that a whole Company [120 men][ had been transferred from the Melbourne Troopship “Hoiorata” to the Omrah at Albany.  They were overcrowded on their own boat.  On Saturday, Nov. 7th we were considered to be in the danger zone, being just about opposite - - - - - in the Indian Ocean.  At night the ships closed up and showed as little light as possible.  About this time the weather was beginning to get rather warm during the day, but we had cool breezes at night.  The sunsets are glorious, different every day.  We get war news by wireless and are kept up to date in that line but I can tell you, I would rather be getting wireless messages from home.  
            We have a large canvas bath rigged up on the well deck, about 10 feet by 12 feet by 3 feet deep. (roughly 3 metres by 4 metres by 1 metre).  It is filled with sea water and the chaps have a good time in it.  The F Company lads went off their heads one day and started throwing each other in with their clothes. The fun waxed fast and furious but things got too hot and the officers stopped them.  I just managed to escape.
            The following is the news of Monday 9th November.:-  Going at the same pace (about 10 knots).  This morning we notice a large cruiser [Japanese] (the Japs were our allies in WW1 although I don’t know that they did much) tearing across our front and learned that something was wrong on the left flank.  A little later we heard by wireless that the H.M.A.S. Sydney had had an engagement with the “Emden” (a German battleship) at Cocos Island.  The excitement on board was great and we eagerly awaited further news.  We are nearing the Equator line and the weather is very hot.  We sleep on deck at night, it is unbearable below.
            Nov. 10th :-  Slept on the poop deck last night but was disturbed by a storm.  The latest news of the fight that we got by wireless is that those in charge of the wireless station at Cocos Island noticed a strange warship and sent out S.O.S. messages which were received by the “Sydney”  and 20 minutes after she [the Sydney] was within range.  The strange vessel proved to be the “Emden”.  The “Sydney” opened fire and blew off the funnels and ripped up the main deck of the “Emden”, only receiving slight damage herself by the latter’s fire. The Captain of the “Emden” beached his boat to save it from sinking and the “Sydney” then chased and captured a German collier, took off the crew and sunk her.  The “Sydney” returned to the “Emden” which surrended.  Before that the “Emden” had damaged the wireless station and cut one of the cables.  Those on the Island got great credit for sticking to their posts. The “Sydney” is taking the prisoners to Colombo.
            Friday, Nov. 13th.   Today at 8 a.m. we crossed the line but the event was celebrated yesterday afternoon when Father Neptune and his staff performed his duty well.  Everyone within reach was grabbed, lathered with whitewash and shaved with a piece of tin, then thrown in the canvas bath.  Some of the chaps showed fight but it was no use, they had to get their ducking.  At the end Father Neptune himself was thrown into the bath and all his assistants.  During the last few days a competition has been held to see which Company was the best at rifle exercises and F Company won 1st and 2nd prizes in the whole Battalion. Each Company had four squads in.    This morning the New Zealand boats left us so as to get to Colombo to coal up.  Beastly weather, plenty of rain and not a dry spot on deck.
            Monday,  Nov. 16th.  We are anchored outside Colombo, about half a mile from the shore.  It seems to be a pretty place with many large buildings about.  Long before we stopped we passed numbers of catamarans and the natives were very clever in managing these strange looking boats.  Our fleet is all here and the boats are very close together.  We are now allowed to have lights on deck, which is a pleasure after having to get about in the dark at night.  Just received news of the death of Lord Roberts.  Great excitement caused when we heard that a number of German prisoners were to be brought on board the “Omrah” to be taken to England, some of those the Sydney had taken off the Emden.   They arrived about 4.30 p.m., 44 of them including 2 officers, in a motor boat from the Sydney  which is in the harbour here.  Try and fancy you were here and see a thousand soldiers thronging the side of the “Omrah” trying to get a look at the prisoners as they were coming on board. These Germans were received by a guard with fixed bayonets and lined up on the main deck.  Their two officers were taken in and given refreshments while the men were conducted to their new quarters.  A permanent guard has been formed of old soldiers to look after them, I had a good view of the proceedings.  When the business was finished the anchor was raised and we moved in slowly towards Colombo.  As we passed within stones throw of ship after ship the cheering from each was deafening and we answered it with a will.  We passed through the gateway of the breakwater just as it was getting dark and the inside seemed crowded with shipping.
            Tonight the sight is one of a lifetime.  I wish I could describe it properly.  The lights of Colombo, the revolving light high up on the lighthouse and those on the numerous ships, including three or four cruisers, motor boats and steam launches buzzing about make things look like fairyland.  We are indeed having a great experience but I would like to be able to have those near and dear to me to share it. Now that we have prisoners of war on board we realize that this is not a pleasure trip but that there may be something very serious at the end of it.
            Tuesday, Nov. 17th.   Our first near view of Colombo this morning was great.  Inside the breakwater was crowded with shipping and flags of all nations were showing, swarms of native baots were moving about and the Singalese (now called Sri-Lankans) were dressed in loose robes of the gayest of colours.  On shore there appeared many large buildings and numerous small ones, nearly all red-roofed, and forests of coco-nut palms in the background. 
            There was plenty to interest us all day [we were not allowed ashore]. First thing two or three niggers came aboard with papers and post-cards, others in boats were all round the “Omrah”, trying to sell cigars, cigarettes, coco-nuts, bananas, etc.. One grey headed old chap wanted four shillings a bunch for bananas and sixpence each for coconuts but he got a hot reception and was glad to clear off.  Some great diving was done by the niggers after silver coins, one chap, for a shilling, dived off the boat deck, a distance of about 40 feet.  All day long the water was crowded with boats and once a steam tug passed us towing 21 water barges.  There seem to be many German boats detained here, supposed to be 17.  A Japanese four-funnelled cruiser is just near us and have their national flag flying.  It must be their washing day for they have about 16 lines of washing hanging out, stretching from the end of the boat to a cross-piece high up on the mast.  There is an old type of Russian cruiser here with five funnels, just near the Japanese and a little further on is the good old H.M.A.S. Sydney.  We learned today that the fittings off the Emden were to be taken to Australia to adorn the Federal Capital.
            All day long we have been taking in water and about 5 p.m. the anchor was heaved up and we passed slowly out.  Our last view of Colombo was one of the prettiest I have ever seen and I will long remember it.  The sun was very low and the light soft and yellowish and the effect was lovely.  It is beyond my power to describe it.   We stopped outside the breakwater till 8 p.m. before continuing our voyage and the numerous lights of Colombo and of the shipping looked lovely.  Three very brilliant searchlights were playing and showed up everything within range as bright as day.  Moving pictures were shown tonight for the first time but were not very clear.  The German prisoners are being kept very quiet, the officers are not allowed to speak to their men.  One of the German prisoners told some of the chaps that are guarding them that we will all be sent to hell long before we reach England.  If that happens thank goodness they will go with us.
            Wednesday, 18th.   We are travelling at about 12 knots. The sea is very calm and smooth, we have had no rough weather at all. One chap here said he believes the Bay of Biscay will stop rolling as soon as we get there.  We could see land this morning on the starboard side, the only sight of India we are likely to get.  All the New Zealand boats have gone on ahead of us and only nine other troopships are with us  -  two lines of five each and a cruiser in front.
            Today was pay day, we only get ten shillings a fortnight, not nearly enough to keep us going.  The German prisoners seem to be starting their tricks already.  This morning one fat German officer asked the sentry to take a towel to one of the other prisoners.  It was nicely folded up and the sentry took it to the captain of the guard who shook it out and a note dropped from it.  We have not heard what the contents of the note are but the prisoners are watched more closely.  The German officers were offered parole when they came on board but refused.
            Monday, Nov. 23rd.   Since getting up this morning we have been in sight of land, Sokotra Island, near the bay of Aden.  Before you get this letter we will be in England if all goes well.  We expect to get to Aden Tuesday night, 24th Nov., three months since we left Gympie

          <article class="letter"> 
            <p>
            Dear Mother,<br>
            About six hundred of Australian wounded [including myself] have arrived at the above address and all are in good spirits.  Of course those who were very severely wounded were left at Alexandria and there was a great number of them too.  But I believe I am starting at the wrong end, so will go back a little over a week when we were on board the “Malda” in Lemnos Island Harbour. I could go back even further than that to the time when we left Mena Camp [Feb. 28th] and sailed by the troopship “Ionian” to Lemnos Island, of our five weeks under canvas there and all our experiences, etc.;  but I am afraid it would take too long and at present there is plenty of later news to write about.
            Well, to resume my story – we were on board the Troopship “Malda” on Saturday, April 24th, waiting for British destroyers to take us to the place where we were to land and meet the Turks.  At 10 p.m. we had our last meal on the “Malda” and somewhere about midnight, two destroyers came alongside and we were immediately transhipped to them.  Previously to this though, the “Malda” had left Lemnos Harbour with us and taken a few hours trip to some place unknown.  It was at this place that the destroyers joined us and our Company went on board the “Colne” and we steamed away from the “Malda” in the direction of the Dardanelles. We were all crowded on the deck, quite comfortable, and at 3 a.m. hot cocoa was served out to all hands.  About this time the “Colne” stopped and it was 4.30 a.m. before she moved on again.  We had not gone far before land could be seen ahead and we all then got into small boats which were alongside.  The order was given to push off and make for land, just as day was beginning to break.  The oarsmen gave way with a will and we were still 100 yards from shore when the exciting times commenced.  There were six boat-loads of us and many others from other destroyers and cruisers all making for the shore at once.
            The Turks must have been expecting us for their bullets began to fly all round the boats.  Luckily not one in our boat was hit but others did not get off so well, for one fellow was killed and many were wounded.  When our boat grounded we jumped out, almost up to the hips in water and made for the shore.  It was my luck to step into a hole and I went almost under water, getting my rifle wet, but I managed to get to land otherwise unhurt.  George Thomas was with us and gave the order to  “Fix bayonets, open out and advance.”  Ahead of us was a steep hill covered with thick undergrowth from 2 feet to 5 feet high and forming excellent cover for the enemy and also ourselves, but not bullet-proof.  We got to the top of the first hill, about 100 feet high, in quick time and without mishap, the Turks retreating before us as we advanced.  Ahead of us as far as we could see the country was all hills and gullies covered with the same thick undergrowth. 
            It was now broad daylight and as we forged onward an occasional bullet would whiz past unpledasantly close, but the enemy were poor rifle shots, for when we got to the top of the next hill only two had been wounded.  We all got mixed up as we advanced owing to the nature of the country and I lost sight of most of my own mates.  At this point not many of the enemy were opposed to us, although we came across many abandoned kit-bags and gear, as if they had left in a hurry. But on our left the firing was fairly heavy and continuous so the party I was with moved in that direction and we were soon in the thick of it.  By this time many British battleships had opened fire on the Turkish forts and also on the enemy artillery, their shells flying over our heads and making an awful row.  We drove the Turks back and captured four guns, many tents and ammunition, but reinforcements did not come up to us fast enough and we were forced to retire – but not for long.  The enemy took up a strong position behind the top of a hill and there were many thousands of them including many German officers.  They easily outnumbered us and had plenty of artillery and machine guns.  All we had to depend on was our rifle fire and 1 or 2 machine guns so their advantage over us was indeed great.  The fire of the enemy was absolutely murderous but our fellows advanced again and again and were dropping in all directions but would not be stopped.
            That Sunday the Australians proved what stuff they were made of and many a one made a hero of himself, and many a poor fellow died urging his mates onward with his last breath.  The hail of bullets was simply awful and the shrapnel shells were bursting round us all the time.  They must have expended a marvellous amount of ammunition.  Many of our officers were shot down and most of the time we got no orders at all but had to rely on ourselves and do the best we could.  At any time we did happen to see an officer the order was always the same, “Get ahead, lads, and stick it into them.”  Another advantage the Turks had over us was a thorough knowledge of the country and they had the ranges for their fire.  And I suppose they were fresh too, but we had been up all the night before, got wet coming ashore and had had no breakfast, although we had food in our haversacks but had no time to eat it.
            The Battalions were all mixed up and I saw very few of my own Coy..  Once I spotted Monty Woodyatt and gave him a call; he yelled out to me to come his way and we both forged ahead but got seperated almost immediately and I never saw him again.  I heard later that he had been shot dead but do not yet know if it is true. Shortly after seeing Monty I joined Geo. Thomas and Billy Money behind some bush and the bullets were raining around us thick and fast.  The cries of the wounded men about us were deadly and there were no stretcher-bearers about.  Our position became too hot for us so Bill Money and I dashed ahead; I do not know how the  bullets managed to miss us.  We kept going ahead in short rushes and soon were almost near enough to resume firing again.  As usual we were lying down behind bushes which formed a good cover but were not bullet proof. We had only been in this position a few minutes when I felt a thud in the back and afterwards found that a bullet had ripped the side of my haversack and tore a hole through a tin of “bully-beef” that I had in it.  Our haversacks were strapped to our backs for convenience.  It was a close shave but everyone was getting used to close shaves by then.
            You know, Mother, it might sound like skite but I’m satisfied that the old tale that a soldier nearly dies of fright when first under fire is all bosh. I heard many of our fellows say the same thing.  It makes you feel a bit uncomfortable but it also makes you want to get at the enemy and pay it all back with interest.  There was one bad point about our fellows, they were too eager and rushed ahead in any sort of order, often exposing themselves unneccessarily.  Within a minute of getting one in my haversack, I heard a groan beside me and saw Bill Money’s head drop.  We were lying at full length on our stomachs.  He said, “Ray, I’m hit” and I, with the aid of another chap who was near turned him over and got his equipment off.  When I opened out his coat and shirt there was a bullet hole showing high up on his left breast, it might have been in the shoulder blade and very little blood was coming from it.  Poor old Bill was almost unconscious and asked me if it had touched his heart.  Of course I told him that it had not and that it would be alright.  We managed to put on his “first field dressing” [one of which we all carry] and gave him a drink of water.  We made him as comfortable as possible under the circumstances and I stacked his gear in front of his head so as to stop another bullet from hitting him. All the time I was expecting to get lobbed myself for the fire of the enemy was simply hellish.  So fast and thick were the bullets coming that some of the time the sound of them was for all the world like the buzz of an electric fan – a continual hum.  We had only just got Bill fixed when another chap on the other side of me was shot through the arm.  The bullet must have cut an artery for when I cut open his sleeve the blood poured out and my hands were smothered in blood.  We bound his arm as well as we could and told him to crawl to the rear.  Two other chaps near us stopped bullets  so I thought it was time to stop attending to wounded men for it is greatly against military rules for riflemen to stop to attend to wounds. Everyone unhurt was needed in the firing line, so I had another look at Bill Money who seemed quite unconscious and then retired a little to see if I could get any stretcher-bearers but there were none about and they were yelling out for more men so I joined a few chaps who were advancing and moved up with them.  We went to the right of where I had left poor old Bill, so I did not see him again.  Later in the day one of my Company told me he had seen Bill making his way towards the beach so I am in hopes that he is getting on alright.  I would give anything to be sure of it.
            As we advanced the fire, if possible, became hotter but I seemed to bear a charmed life, one bullet ripped through my left coat sleeve at the wrist without touching my arm. Shortly afterwards, when lying down, my water bottle stopped one and I lost all the water, which was a serious loss indeed.  But I had a still narrower escape when a bullet tore through the collar of my tunic right under my chin.  The badge must have turned it aside for there is a dent in it and a little bit of lead sticking to it.   My collar was turned up a little for the bullet hit from the underneath side.  I am thinking of cutting it off and sending it home to you for a keepsake. 
            It was not till about 3 p.m. that I was put out of action, when we were giving the Turks some hot fire and, of course, getting it hot in return.  Their shrapnel was very deadly and we would hear the shells go whizzing over our heads and then go off with a bang.  These shells contain hundreds of bullets and when they burst the bullets fly out.  It was a shrapnel bullet that got me. A    shell burst just a few yards to the left of me [I was lying down] and the sensation I got was as if someone had hit me with a large club full force on the muscle on the left arm.  At the same time something hit me on the right forearm and left a black bruise there. My left arm was now useless and the blood was flowing freely so I thought it was time to retire and accordingly did so, dodging bullets all the time.
            A few hundred yards back from the firing line I met one of our sergeants (what the hell’s the Sgt. doing there? D.B.) who put on my first field dressing.  I saw then that a bullet had gone right through my arm near the shoulder, the hole in each side being about half an inch in diameter.  I had nearly two miles to go to the beach – it was a deadly journey.  I expected to get a few more gentle reminders from the beastly Turks for stray bullets were whistling about all the time.  Anyway I got to the beach without further harm and now I am none the worse for my experience.  It was hard luck to be put out of action the first day, but still I had about ten hours of it  - and it was hot stuff,too. Some old soldiers who have been in action before say they have never seen or heard anything like it.  They say there would be nothing in France to equal it. 
            It was a very severe day for the Australians and we suffered heavily.  Colonel Lee [who was shot through the hand] was greatly cut up and was heard to exclaim, “Oh! My poor Ninth, my poor Ninth, they will be cut to pieces, they are bearing the brunt of it all.” The scene on the beach in the afternoon was awful – the doctors and ambulance men had their hands full; wounded men were lying everywhere.  I saw George Thomas and Billy McGowan on the beach, both wounded in the shoulder, the former rather badly, I think.  Even on the beach we were not too safe for the enemy were firing on the battleships and their shrapnel was bursting over us all the time.  Unless you happened to be there you would hardly credit how marvellous were some of the escapes from death and the many different kinds of wounds showed that after all there are not many parts of the human body on which bullets prove fatal.  One chap was shot right through the head, the bullet going in about an inch behind one eye and coming out an inch behind the other. He is not much the worse for it except that he has two lovely black eyes and they are nearly closed up, but his sight is not injured.  There are many fellows with bullets still in their heads and they are doing alright.  One poor chap was struck deaf and dumb by the bursting of a shrapnel shell close over his head but was otherwise unhurt. Another fellow who had half his face blown off just coolly finished himself off with his own rifle. A mate of his was with him at the time.
            Dear Mother, I suppose you will think I am giving you too much of the horrors of war, but I thought you all would like to know all I could tell you about our first engagement. Here is one amusing incident to tone it down a little.  A private was lying down behind cover near the firing line when someone else dashed up and dropped down beside him.  The private noticed at once that he had no rifle so he roared at him, “What are you doing up here without a rifle you d----- fool.”  The other fellow [who happened to be an officer] just calmly replied, “Officers don’t carry rifles, you d----- fool.”  I suppose the private would feel rather small, that is, if he had time to.
            As quickly as possible the wounded were taken off in boats – the very bad cases going to the Hospital ship and the others to the transport ships that were lying near.  About 800 [including myself] were placed on board the Clan MacGillivary; the hospital ship was filled and two or three other troopships, so you can see there was a great number of wounded, somewhere about 5,000 I think.  It was near 5 p.m. when we boarded the Clan Mac  -  and did not leave her till this morning.  Since then we have, I mean since we went on board the Clan Mac  -  up till this morning, we have slept on the hard lower deck and lived on biscuits, cheese and jam.
            You know, dear Mother, we first went to Alexandria where they found there would not be room for us so only the worse cases were taken off.  The next morning after our arrival there, the “Clan Mac” turned tail with us and made for Malta.  We all growled a bit at first at being cooped up on board for a few more days but now I am glad for the climate here will be miles better than Egypt.  Mr. Thomas was taken off at Alexandria.  Capt. Jackson was wounded but he was on some other boat.  I do not think his was a bad case.  Nearly all our officers were wounded and I believe 2 or 3 were killed.
            Wed.,  May 5th.  The Clan Mac dropped anchor in Malta harbour early yesterday morning and after breakfast we were taken ashore in lighters drawn by steam tugs.  We are now quartered in barracks, 12 men being in each room and we are quite comfortable.  I am on the 3rd Floor and there is a lovely view of the forts and the sea on one side and of the city on the other.  We have electric light and plenty of water laid on and very convenient.  The people are very kind and gave us a warm welcome.  We are allowed to stroll about and yesterday many of us visited the English school, to the great delight of the kiddies, who seemed to think we were great heros. They pestered the life out of us for badges and foreign coins and gave us great bunches of lovely flowers.  Our room looks quite gay with the flowers I got. We had quite a gay time with the youngsters and the school mistress [who is a bosker girl] could get no work out of them for the rest of the day.
            Yesterday afternoon the school kids were going round with chocolates and cigarettes and also papers and magazines for the poor wounded Australians. This room in which I am writing was opened to us yesterday and paper, pens and ink supplied free – also soft drinks.  The chaplain stationed here is a fine fellow and works hard for the entertainment of the soldiers as do also many of the ladies.
            And now dear home folk, I hope I have not wearied you with such a long epistle – anyway I am just about at the end of my tether, but will write again soon. I have no idea how long I will be here but reckon my arm will be quite well in a fortnight or less, so if my luck is in I may be back at the front before you get this letter.  It is a long time since I had a letter and goodness knows when we are likely to get another mail.  But keep on writing for we may get them sometime or other.  I only hope you are all enjoying the best of health and continue to do so and that this letter reaches you alright.  We have been told that these letters will not be censored.  While at Alexandria I sent you a p.c. written in a hurry.
            Well, good-bye dear Mother, with the best of love to you all.  Hope Dad is in good nick, also the girls and Herb.  I would very much like to know if you got the news of the Australians fighting at Gallipoli and what the papers said about it.  I think we did our duty.

              Still going strong and keeping in good health.  I was awfully pleased to get Mother’s letter but the parcel has not yet arrived, nor has Dot’s letter.  Always address my letters to Egypt as I think I will have a better chance of getting them.  Many Australian papers find their way here, I have seen those up to June 5th – some Gympie ones among them.  Any news from Australia is welcome here, Gympie news to me especially.  My news must keep, for reasons known to you.  Hope all at home are well.  Best of love to all.

        <button class="accordion">Anzac, Gallipoli, 24/8/15</button>
          <article class="letter">
            <p>Dear Mother,
              This being the anniversary of the day I left Gympie I feel that I cannot better occupy what little spare time I have than by writing to the dear ones at home.  Besides, I have just received your most welcome and interesting letter of July 7th with the lodge card inside and have decided to answer it at once. Can you picture me sitting in my dug-out behind the firing line, my back against the wall and this small pad on my knee.  Geo. Jamieson is with me also my other mate, Bill Rann, both busy with their correspondence.  Now and then a shell lobs over fairly close and bursts but we take no notice of them at all.  A little firing is going on in the trenches but on the whole things are very quiet.  We three have been working with the Engineers sapping for a few weeks for a change. 
              Just now had a narrow escape.  A Howitzer shell [6 inch] from John Turk lobbed on top of another chap’s dug-out a few feet from here and half buried him.  The force of the explosion brought down dirt in our dug-out and nearly smothered us.  Strange to say the other poor fellow was not hurt by the shell but suffered greatly from shock.  He has been carried away on a stretcher but will soon be alright.  Twice lately Bill Rann and I have had narrow escapes, once with a piece of shell and then by a shrapnel bullet.  Both times the “messenger of death” passed between us – I am keeping them as mementos.           
              I do hope, Mother dear, these tales do not worry you because it is all part of the game and they are of daily occurrence.  Another narrow escape three of us had was when I was looking through the telescope at the Observation Post to see what “Abdul” the Turk was doing.  The two others were beside me when suddenly a rifle bullet whizzed through the sandbags and splashed dirt all over us.  Both the other two got nasty cuts on the left hand from small stones but I escaped unhurt.  Oh! We do have all sorts of experiences too numerous to mention here – and perhaps I am rather out of order in writing as much as I have, but hang it all, I guess you like to hear something of our doings.
              The Gympie boys are all well, including this child.  Jim Graham especially is the very picture of health.  I was not too well for a while and lost some weight but now I am picking up again and feel fit.  Tea is now ready Mother so I will resume later – we have been lazy today and have not cooked anything so have to put up with “bully-beef” and onions with a little vinegar we cadged.
              Tea, such as it was, is over so now I must get on with this epistle and I hope you do not mind me writing on both sides of the paper as it is rather scarce – I must be as saving as possible.  The evenings are drawing in now and I will not have much longer to write before dark.  Very often we all get out on the bank to watch the sunset and it is never twice the same.  You could never see anything so beautiful as some of the sunsets we have here – it is beyond me to describe them.   There is every sign of winter approaching, I do hope we will not have to spend it here, it would be deadly indeed. 
              And now, dear Mother, I must refer to your letter and make comments on several of the items.  First of all I cannot understand how you come to think I have been wounded again; before now I hope you know otherwise as you will if you get my letters.  Remember me to Mr. and Mrs. Munt, I am glad Bill was there to liven you all up a bit.  Please thank Mrs. Munt for her thoughtfulness although the parcel has not yet arrived, but very likely it will as they are better looked after now than at first.  Tom Johnstone often receives one from a friend in Gympie, generally biscuits, chocolates and cigarettes.  It seems wonderful that Mrs. Davis still manages to enjoy a certain amount of health, give her my kind regards and thank her for the message.  I hope Beryl’s indisposition was only of short duration, give her my love and ask her to write sometimes. That just reminds me – I received a letter from Uncle Joe today, it was quite a surprise but I was jolly glad to hear from him.  Edwin seems to be a big hit with Doris, will it last?  I have heard Jim Graham and Geo. Jamieson speak of him and I believe he is a decent kid.  An uncle of his I think, Bill Router, was my fireman at the Scottish, I would like to be remembered to him. Getting dark – good night, sweet repose, and pleasant dreams.
              26/8/15.  2 p.m..   Until now, dear Mother, I have had no time to get on with this letter but hope to finish this time.  We work 4 hours in the “saps” and have 8 off – the 8 off is spent in cooking mostly and cleaning up ourselves and our dug-outs.  We try to keep as clean as possible although water is scarce and we cannot wash very often. 
              The last two nights, while on duty from 8 to 12 p.m., Bill Rann and I have had to go out between our firing line and the Turks to get the lay of the country and to shift dirt that was in the way of sapping operations.  There being a spice of danger in it we quite enjoyed ourselves.  It was bright moonlight and John Turk spotted us and had a few pot shots but there was small chance of us getting hit.  Last night I discovered the remains of a Turk’s outfit but all I got out of it was 10 rounds of their ammunition which I am keeping.  We always seem to be lucky, Bill and I, for we had only got back to the trenches a few minutes when an engineer chap who was outside got shot through the left arm – a very bad wound.  Here is a little item, Mother, that may seem ghastly to you but which we consider nothing at all – the chap in the next sap to us dug out a dead Turk [half gone] the other day and burnt the remains in the trench – by jove he did hum; the ashes were bagged and buried.  All this I am telling you I consider to be of “private and family matters” as stated on the envelope. 
              Today, to us, has been like Xmas day because a great number of things arrived which were bought from the Regimental Fund and have been distributed amongst us.  Here are some of the items:- cigarettes[9 packets per man], tobacco and matches, fancy biscuits, tinned fish, sausages, golden syrup, bottles of sauce, vinegar, paste, writing pads, shaving soap and other soap, lead pencils, candles, epsom salts, sox, chocolates and various other things.  Not too bad to get things like that in the firing line, is it?
              So you had a visit from Herb, I was glad to hear that he had a decent job, it would be alright if he could work into something permanent like that in the Government – a Labor government, too.  You say Mag would not mind washing my greasy togs, tell her I would not mind if I was home chopping copper-wood for her. And don’t you dare try your hand again at sawing wood, the idea!  I was sorry I could not send you the piece of collar and badge but I could not get a new tunic so had to sew up the tear and I still wear the same old coat.  While at Malta I washed it – here we do our washing in the sea. when we go for a swim.
              So sorry Mrs. Cockburn has been unwell, give her my love and please thank all those you mentioned for their good wishes. I think now dear Mother, I must end this letter but you may be sure I will write again soon. There are many letters, I think, written to me that I do not receive, I calculate there must be between 20 and 30.  There may be some chance of us getting relieved for the winter – I hope so, the continual strain is wearing our fellows out.  One of the worst things we have to put up with is the smell of the dead soldiers [Turks and Australians] who remain unburied between the firing lines – but we even get used to that.  This may be rather dusty but we live in dirt, sleep in it, eat it with our food and have our clothes full of it. There are millions of flies here and they are awful pests.  There are many boats in the sea – namely destroyers, cruisers, supply ships, hospital ships and others.  Sometimes German airships fly over and drop a few bombs but they generally drop them where they do no harm.  Our aeroplanes do good work and we often watch them hovering over us, sometimes up to four at a time.  The buzz of their engines is quite easily heard on the ground – I can hear one now. 
              Well, dearest Mum and Dad, I must close, hoping this reaches you unopened – with best love to all.</p>

          <article class="letter">
            <p>Dear Dad,
              Having been issued with another envelope I am again able to write a letter without much chance of it being opened.   I have answered Mothers last letter and have since received one from Ivy which was very welcome although there was no news in it – it was dated July 11th.   The parcel has not yet turned up but they are generally longer in coming than letters and I am living in expectations of receiving it any time now.
              We are jogging along as usual, things being very quiet in general except for daily artillery duels and we are constantly dodging shrapnel and high explosives.  There is a fair amount of sickness among the troops – the hard life for such a long time is beginning to tell and every day some are being sent away for a spell – our Company is only about ½ strength.  When we landed here in April we were overstrength and since then we have received six lots of reinforcements of from 120 to 150 in each – now the 9th is about 700 strong or less.  There are many yarns about that we are about to be relieved within a fortnight for the winter months but we do not know what to believe.  Anyway, I suppose you will know as soon as we do if that happens.  We all think here that it would be a good plan if they sent the 1st Division to Australia for the winter months – don’t you?
              The other day I got a great surprise – young Ted Eardley turned up here to see me – the lad that was in the Compression Room at the Scottish on my shift.  He is just as wild as ever and seemed quite delighted to meet me.  He has only been here a week – landed with the 11th Light Horse – left Australia in June. There is really not much to write about, dear Dad, for the days pass one after another in much the same way – the things we look forward most is mail day and bread day.  We have become that sick of hard biscuits that we can hardly bear to look at them – the only way we can eat them now is to soak them in water and then fry them in fat.  You would laugh to hear our conversation sometimes on the food question.  Half a dozen of us will get together and each will tell the rest what he most longs for.  Not being able to get what we like, I fancy will make us appreciate the good things if we get back.  How I would like to be sitting down with you all to a good cup of tea and a hot scone and butter.  Butter!  I have not tasted it for over 3 months.  We feel like kings when we get bread and are quite satisfied to eat jam and treacle with it.  Just fancy, I have not spoken to a female since I left Malta or seen one since leaving Egypt the second time.  Well I am living in hopes of living the good times over again.
              Just tell Mother not to worry about me, I am doing A1 and I feel quite confident that I will continue to do so.  Please remember me to George Thomas and Capt. Jackson, many of the fellows here wish they were back with us.  The officer in charge of our Coy. is Lt. Chambers, they will know him, he is far from being popular with the lads.
              Well Dad, I have to get the tea now [4.20 p.m.] so will close this rather poor letter hoping all at home are in good health and spirits.  Remember me to all friends and relations.  Just heard that another mail is in, hope there is something for me.</p>

          <article class="letter"> 
            <p>
            My Dear Mother,<br>
            It is over a month since I last wrote to you and my conscience has troubled me greatly but really I have not had time.   At Lemnos we were kept fairly busy during the day while at night the condition of things rendered writing pretty well impossible.  During the last few weeks at Lemnos we had lovely weather, ideal for Xmas.  We had a much better time than we had last Xmas – especially in the food line.  Our billy-cans were distributed on Xmas-eve and it would have done you good to see the behaviour of the men – they acted just as children would on getting their Xmas stocking.  It was quite exciting opening up the billies to see the contents.  All of ours came from Victoria, we were sorry the Queensland billies did not come to us. Mine was from the Hon. J. K. Merrit, M.L.C., Kew, Victoria and contained many good things including this pad on which I am writing, envelopes, pencil, pipe tobacco, cigarettes, mouth-organ, ginger-nuts, raisins, handkerchief, oxo cubes, etc.  I must write and thank the sender when I have time.
            We left Lemnos on the 31st Dec. and boarded the “Grampian” a fine ship of about 15,000 tons, the best we have yet been on.  The strange part of it was that we were all placed in berths – four in each cabin, we were most comfortable and had also very good food while on board.  On 8a.m. on New Year’s Day we steamed out of the harbour of Lemnos, most likely for the last time, escorted by the Cruiser “Cornwallis”.  During the day everybody had to wear life-belts and many men were placed on the look out for “submarines”.  We of the Machine Gun Section had a gun mounted on each side of the boat and loaded ready for action and took turns on watch in case of need.  Anyway, nothing unusual occurred and we arrived at Alexandria 48 hours after leaving Lemnos Is.. 
            Jan 3rd.  About 8 o’clock that night we disembarked from the “Grampian”, entrained at the wharf and by 9 p.m. made a start for our new camp.  It happened to be raining at the time which made things very unpleasant for us.  During the train journey we were stopped many times and did not arrive at our destination until 4 a.m. the next morning and it was still raining. There were no tents for us and we were told to make ourselves as comfortable as possible till daylight.  A couple of others and myself roamed about till we found shelter under a pile of old sleepers.  We are learning now to take things as they come and to make the best of a bad job.  The second night we made cover with some timber borrowed from the engineers, it was still raining.  The third night, which was dry, we camped in a transport waggon and were quite comfortable. Since then we have had tents.
            When we left the “Grampian” we did not know where we were going but found, the morning we arrived here, that our camp was situated on the famous battlefield of Tel-el-Kebir, about midway between Cairo and Ishmalia.  The battle was fought somewhat over 30 years ago, I know very little about it.  Somehow or other we are always camped at some place of historical interest, first at Mena, then Lemnos Island, Gallipoli and now Tel-el-Kebir.  This camp is much the same as Mena but will be much larger when all the soldiers are here.  It is all on one side of the Railway line and starts from the 1st Australian Batt. and going in order to the 31st or over.  We have heard that 500,000 men are to be concentrated here and that the “camp” will be 20 miles in length.  On our side of the railway line there is nothing but miles and miles of desert but across the line is a canal running parallel with it and beyond that lovely green fields and cultivated land with palm and other trees here and there – a contrast indeed.
            The first day we had nothing to do so in the afternoon we three, T.J.,  G.J. and I explored the old entrenchments and gun emplacements of the old Battlefield.  In some places chaps had been digging for curios and had rooted up human bone and skulls and old clothes on which you could see signs of blood and bullet holes.
            The camp is now very busy, most battalions up to the 26th being here and all day long drilling is going on out on the sand.  The Machine Gun Sections of the 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th all work together under Lieut. Steele and we are getting on fine.  We parade daily from 9 a.m. to 12 noon and from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. except Saturday, when we have a half holiday and Sunday when only Church Parade is held.  We are learning, besides the gun work, signalling, range-finding, judging distances, observation, description of targets, etc. etc..
            Monday, 10th Jan.  Dear Mother of mine, I have been pressed for time and only now am able to resume this letter.  I will try and give you an idea of our days work.  Reveille sounds at 6 a.m. and we have to turn out smartly, which is much against the grain, roll up the tent flap, pack up our blankets and gear in a neat line outside the tent, clean up the previous night’s mess, go for a wash and clean our rifles. By then it is 8 0’clock and the breakfast arrives and consists generally of porridge and tea. to which we add something of our own buying.  We just about get washed up when the corporal yells out, “Fall In” at 8.45 for inspection of rifles and at 9 o’clock we go out with the guns, returning at midday.  Dinner is at 1 p.m. and we parade again from 2 to 4 p.m..  Tea is at 5 p.m. and before we have finished the sun has set and it is getting dark.   After tea we perhaps go for a walk, play cards, read, talk or argue the point on various subjects.
            This is rather an out of the way place, nearly 3 hours by train from Cairo and leave is being granted at the rate of 270 per day – 48 hours at a time.  In our section one man gets leave each day and, dear Mother, tomorrow it is my turn and I am going to have 48 hrs in Cairo. 
            Wed. Jan. 12th.  Dear Mother, I am now seated in the Esbekia Gardens in the heart of Cairo, in an enclosure for soldiers run by English and Australian ladies.  Here we can sit at tables quite comfortably and write and can also purchase drinks, tea, scones or cake at reasonable prices.  I arrived in Cairo last night at 6 o’clock and proceeded to the Hotel Metropole, engaged a room and had dinner, then strolled forth to have a look round.  It was great to feel free for awhile with no officers to be ordering one about.  For the first time since leaving Malta I slept between sheets and appreciated the change very much – it was so nice that I did not rise till 9 o’clock and had a late breakfast at ten.  My first business this morning was to visit Thos. Cook and Sons and through them to despatch a parcel to you containing a curious collection of articles which I hope you will receive safely.  There is a Turk’s water bottle which I found in front of our trenches, a Nose-cap of a shell which Abdul sent over our lines at Anzac.  My old Service Cap which was issued at Lemnos Is. last March and which I have worn ever since.  It was getting rather shabby but I did not want to throw it away for I had got to like it, so I sent it in the parcel and even left the badge on – just hang it up in my room.  A Gas Helmet which I had at Gallipoli – we always carried them in case the Turks attacked with gas.  A Bandolier containing all sorts of things such as badges, pieces of high explosive shell which only missed me by inches, a few shrapnel  bullets which came close at different times.  Piece of Alabaster stone from the Pyramids, carried with me since last February. Buttons, all of which have a history, Turkish clips of cartridges and some English Mark VII , too.  A First Field Dressing which we always carry into action.  A few stones from the battlefield of Tel-el-Kebir.  The badge & piece of Tunic from the collar of my old coat – it was hit by a bullet on April 25th 1915.  Could not send it before as I had no other Tunic to wear. A cigarette packet containing a few coins which I have carried about since last March. There may be a few other things which at present I do not remember.  Please keep them.
            (I have typed in the underlining exactly as Aunt Alice has written it.  D.B.)
            After finishing that little job I called at the Australian Intermediate Base Depot and made enquiries concerning Billy Money.  I looked over the official records myself and all that is there is that he was wounded on April 25th and is now missing. I was informed that nothing whatever is known of him, they think he must be dead.   He must have been taken off the Peninsula alright or otherwise he would not have been reported wounded.  Many of the wounded that died on the boats were buried at sea and no records kept.  I feel awfully sorry for his people – he was such a fine chap and a good son.
            You will know, dear Mother, before this, that I failed to obtain leave to go home, so I cannot help you in any way.  I tried to draw what money is owing to me so that I could send you some but was unable to do so.  I am about 20 Pounds in credit in my pay book.  I have cabled to London for some and will forward it on when it arrives.  For your sake Mother I would like to be home for there is much I could do to help you.  But the war cannot last for ever and the day must surely come when I will see you all again.  Until then dear Mother, keep the flag flying.
            In a letter I received the other day the person said that you were my guardian angel and I really believe it is true.  Since arriving at Tel-el-Kebir I have had about 15 letters and 2 parcels.  Two letters from you, one from Alice and others from Mrs. Crossley, Uncle Tom, Tom Wilbraham, Jack Long, Vera, Mabel Brown, Ray Grant, Mrs.R. Kennedy.  A parcel from Alice Beck and one containing toffee marked from H.G. Bend (or could be H.S. Bend) – Alice’s writing I think, but might be from Miss Ruddle, cannot think of anyone else on the Bend.
            And now, dearest Mother, I must get this letter posted and I will try and write a little more often. With best of love to you all at home, Your loving son,  Ray.
            <br>P.S.  I received your letter that contained the Kangaroo sent by Dad and I treasure it greatly.  Leo Thomas is in Cairo but I have not seen him yet.  Geo. J. has met Mr. Thorley on Lemnos, he was telephone expert at Gympie.   Express my sympathy to the Hays in their bereavement.

          <article class="letter"> 
            <p>Dear Mother,<br>
              You will be wondering what the heading of this letter means but do not worry, it only means that I am in hospital here having quite a comfortable time suffering from appendicitis.  For the first few days it was not too good at all but now I am on the mend and am pleased to say that an operation was considered unneccessary.  This place is about five miles nearer to the Suez Canal than our camp of Gab-el-Habeita at the trenches and is at the railhead that has been built from the canal for transport.  We are very comfortable here in large marquees – the doctors are kind and the attendants very obliging. Inside the tent the floor is covered with tarpaulin and our beds are spread thereon, consisting of an oil-sheet and four blankets.  I was brought in from the trenches in what is called a sand-cart – a spring mattress over which is spread a soft bed.  It is covered in all round and on top and is fitted on two light broad wheels. The turn-out was drawn by four mules in charge of two Indians. 
              At the railhead here things are very busy – all stores and water are brought by motor-trains and then hundreds of camels are used for transporting them to the trenches.  This place will soon have the same appearance as Anzac for stores are accumulating every day, there are cases of biscuits and bully-beef, jam, milk, cheese, bread [comes daily], firewood, timber, fodder, also fresh meat, etc. etc..  Water pipes are being laid right to the trenches and a hard road is being made by Gypos (Egyptians).  One very good thing, dear Mother, that I forgot to mention is – our mail is now being delivered in the trenches.  You will be pleased to hear that I received, before I came here, two lovely letters and a card from you and also a nice long letter from Herb.  One of yours was dated Dec. 30th and the other letter and card Jan. 21st. Herb’s was Jan 21st.  These were indeed welcome for they were the first I had received since leaving Tel-el-Kebir and I was wondering how you were all keeping.  Every time I hear from you, Mother, I wish I was home with you for I am sure I could be of some use [if wishes were airships].  (This is probably a reference to the old saying, ‘If wishes were horses, tramps would ride’).  But the time will surely come and then all will be well, until then take care of yourself and afterwards I will try and take care of you – my best of mothers.  And now I must give up for a while, to continue later on, for the present Hooray all, with the best of love.
              Morning of the 4th.  Last night two of the Doctors examined me and decided that I would be able to go back to the trenches in a day or two [they don’t give a fellow much chance, do they? No rest at the sea-side after sickness here] but they informed me that sooner or later I would have to undergo an operation and have my appendix cut out.  They advised me to be careful and report to our own medical officer if ever I felt a bit off.  Anyway dear Mother, it does not worry me the least bit – what a fine rest I would have – but it may not be for years yet.  At present I am feeling pretty fit and have a fine appetite. 
              I have just been out to have a look at a procession of camels, there were about 400 of them and it was a fine sight.  They were being taken for a drink which, I think, is given them every three days although they could last much longer if required.
              7-3-16.   Gab-el-Habeita No.2 Post.  I am now back at the trenches and feeling quite
              well – it is good to be back among my mates again, after being with strangers.  I arrived here yesterday from the hospital, having to walk all the way in the boiling sun and I can tell you it was no joke struggling along through the sand.  This morning I had to report to the doctor who very kindly told me to have a rest today and not to go on duty till tomorrow.
              The whole of the Australian Force is being reorganized and the batallions are being split up so that the old hands and the new will be mixed up together.  Half of the 9th have been sent away to the 49th Batt. and in their place we have received reinforcements of the 25th Batt. – a weedy crew indeed.  Many of the old hands [including J. Graham] who were sent to the 49th. did not like the idea of leaving the 9th but it had to be.  We of the M. G. S. I am glad to say, are to be kept with the good old 9th.  Tom Johnstone and I have been made the expert range finders for the section.  What an honour!  Soon I think there will be many changes.  Somehow or other the 3rd Brigade generally get the worst of things.  We always, wherever we go, do the pioneering work and get things in going order for others – as, for instance, at Mena Camp, at Lemnos, Gallipoli, Tel-el-Kebir and now in this outlandish hole of a place. By the time the trenches are prepared, roads are made and water laid on we will be moved, for a certainty, to other spheres of labour and go over the whole thing again.  Are we not paying for our reputation?  Two battalions [5th and 6th] of the 2nd Brigade are out here also – and in the official orders yesterday there was a statement that the work of the 3rd Brigade was by far the best and further ahead than the others, soft soap again for the poor 3rd Brigade.
              The latest tale is that very soon we will be going to France and I have an idea that it will come off.  We are all hoping so for the heat here will soon be unbearable.  Our section has just come in from work and they do look hot and tired out.  I must now knock off for dinner which will be the usual old stew and tea.  Dinner being over and the lads away again on parade I now have the tent to myself.  I have shaved, washed and sharpened my lead pencil and now proceed to finish this letter to the home folks.  It has taken a long time in the writing but I have been so unsettled lately that I could not put my mind to it and there is very little to write about.  You at home always come first in my thoughts and I am hoping that all is well with you and that the thing you spoke of has been satisfactorily settled.  Several times lately I have had dreams in which the dear Dad appeared just as he used to be before I left home.
              The locket Mag sent to me I keep in my pocket book and only wish that I had your photo dear Mother for the other side.  I was glad the girls had a good holiday and hope Dot’s health is of the best.  How about the dear home girl, Peg, has she had hers yet?  But I know it would be hard to spare her as the others have their work to do.  The only solution is for you both to try and get away together.  It was indeed a surprise to me to hear that Doris had gone in for nursing – I wonder if she will like it – it may be alright but I don’t fancy it much – does Edwin?  Of course Doris has herself to please, she might be telling me to mind my own business so I’ll say no more.  She can tell Mrs. Davis that I am keeping her silver charm in my left breast pocket, it was awfully kind of her to think of me.  Please thank Mag Willett for her kind wishes – give her my love and ask her to give the kiddies a kiss for me.  I have been reading over your last letters again – they are so interesting and nice and long.  It is an age now since I heard from Dot.  Alice’s letter was very welcome, I hope she will write again.  Tell Alice Beck I have not been able to write to her yet – green envelopes are very scarce and I do not like handing in my letters for censor.  Although of such a striking colour the socks were jolly good – the chaps here wanted to know if I was a ballet-dancer and passed other rude remarks, but they were only jealous.  I am awfully thankful to her for the parcel.
              Must now conclude dearest Mother, with best love to you all at home, 
              <br>Your loving son,
              <br>Ray.
              <br>P.S.  Love to Auntie and Will, also Beryl and others and Winnie Beck – glad she is in Gympie now.</p>

          <article class="letter">
            <p>My Dear Mother,<br>
                Some few days ago I wrote a fairly long letter to Dot, so that at present there is little news to tell you, but I must write to let you know that the parcel you posted about 27th Feb. reached me safely.  Everything is lovely – what good sisters  have and how I thank them.  The cap fits so I shall wear it , also the socks and handkerchiefs, soap, cigarettes and toffee are always welcome.  Oh! how I appreciate anything from home, especially when I know it is the work of your hands [the family, I mean].  Please excuse my presumption if I venture to give you a little hint, it is this – never pack cigarettes and soap together.  The cigarettes become scented and the flavour is not quite up to the mark.  In one of your letters Mother, you said that Miss Hunter was sending the toffee and yet Dot says in her note enclosed in the parcel that she sent the tin of lollies.  What is the solution of that puzzle?  Perhaps the toffee is in another parcel or is the tin of lollies the toffee and was it given to Dot by Miss Hunter for me or did you forget to put in the toffee.  I will not venture to write to Miss Hunter in case there is some mistake, but you must please thank her for me if the circumstances of the case warrant it – it was very kind of her.
                Now dear Mother of mine, I must tell you what little news there is. Last night we packed up and left our billet for the firing line but stopped about a mile behind and camped for the night.  This morning we were roused at 6.30 o’clock, had breakfast and after steel helmets had been issued to us we started off for the front trench. We left our packs behind but took a change of clothing, shaving gear, towel, soap, etc., one blanket, overcoat, oil sheet and various other things, also two respirators.  Machine gunners are given special gaspirators [as we sometimes call them] of the latest pattern.  They are very good and allow one to breathe quite freely.  By 10.30 a.m. we had all the guns and gear in the firing line, viewed the German trenches and got the lay of the land.  Things are fairly quiet here and I fancy we will have a better time than we had at Gallipoli.  In the afternoon Fritz sent over some of his “iron rations” which burst fairly close but did no damage.
                May 19th 1916.  From my dug-out I will continue this letter and hope dear Mother to finish it without further interruption.  Last night I was on the gun from midnight till 4 a.m. and have been on all day today.  The days are very long now, the first signs appearing soon after 2 a.m. when the small birds start their evening hymn.  They sing very sweetly and there are hundreds of them in the trees round about.  The sound of the guns has failed to drive them off, but they must get some awful shocks at times, for the trees often get splintered by shells. The nights are fairly cold and I was glad to have my overcoat on during my watch but during the day the sun is very hot.  The sun sets about 7.45 p.m. and it is quite light up to 9 o’clock, so you see we do not have much more than five hours of darkness.
                Our life here will be something like it was at Gallipoli only better for we will be able to procure plenty to eat – adding to the ordinary rations by sending to the farmhouses which are only a short distance behind the line.  We are to do our own cooking and intend to make the best of it.  I was sorry to hear Mother, that Edwin has decided to come over here and I am sure you will miss him very much.  He has been a good friend to you all and I should very much like to meet him.
                The other day I received letters from Elsie and Marge Lear containing very kind wishes and stating that they expected to have you for Easter.  I hope that if you went you had a good rest and don’t forget you are not to work too hard as you are in the habit of doing.   That is a command, not a request, as we sometimes say to a chap here when asking him to do anything.  When the French people do not understand us they say – ‘no compre’ – so I ask you, do you compre, and you should say, “oui,oui” meaning “yes, yes”.  They nearly always say “yes” twice.
                If you can would you send along a Gympie paper now and again, they would be very welcome.  Some day I may get my leave to visit England, if so I will send a cable to you to let you know all is well.   Now dear Mother I must close [I go on watch at 3 a.m.], hoping your letters come regularly – they are great.  Best of love to the girls, Herb and yourself from
                <br>Your loving son,
                <br>Ray.
                <br>P.S. Remember me to all friends, I hope to see Mrs. Cockburn in Gympie some day as she promised.

            <p>Dear Dot,<br>
              In my dug-out in the support lines I have just come across the enclosed few lines of poetry.  What do you think of them as an argument in favour of continuing the war to a “knock out” until the Central Powers are absolutely crushed and also an argument in favour of conscription which I believe the Queensland Labor Party are dead set against.  If some of them could only go through such experiences as the “Landing at Gallipoli” and the taking of Pozieres perhaps they would change their minds or rather, their opinions.  This is just the time when every man counts and every man is necessary to ensure success.  The more men we have the better it would be for those already here, for it would mean longer spells out of the firing line and consequently better health and more spirited fighting.  Of course most of the men here are in favour of conscription as far as I can judge, bur in a modified form, principally to catch slackers, leaving alone men with families, or sons supporting mothers, etc..  Now in Herbs case for instance, I maintain that it would be a crime for him to come – one is enough where there is only two or three.  So endeth that part of my epistle.
              Lately, dear Dot, I have written quite a lot and feel so proud of myself – I have written to Tom W. today, also to Winnie, Marge Lear, Capt. Thomas, Mrs. Crossley and Agnes Kennedy my Victorian girl – she sent me some pressed Wattle and Violets about the same time as the Wattle came in Mother’s letter.  Tres Bon, eh! Soon I hope to have a trip to the “old dart” as Herb would say, my name has gone in, there is only one other before me.  If I get there my first job will be to cable home just to let you know I am alright.
              During our indirect fire the other night we nearly killed a man.  
              <br>Let me explain – Our gun was placed by the side of the road and firing parallel with it, crossing it [I mean the bullets], down the road about 200 yards where it [I mean the road] took a bend to the left.

          <article class="letter"> 
            <p>
            My Dear Mother,<br>
            Yesterday when resting in my deep dug-out in the firing line your letter of Nov 8th was brought to me and how welcome it was, especially so as it contained a P.C. photo of yourself which I have wished for for so long.  It is a good photo and you look well, but yet I fancy your face reveals signs of much suffering – what hard times you have had little Mother – do you know I will always be proud of you.  A few days ago I posted a long letter to you in a green envelope, mostly containing episodes of my furlough in England and I hope it reaches you safely.  It was written partly at Flers and partly at Havre – now I am in the firing line in charge of a gun, having been sent up to relieve a L/Cpl who was to go on leave to Blighty.
            I had been up once before with a ration party and we had the experience of being lost in “No Mans Land” although we had a guide with us who was supposed to know the way.  It is a simple matter to get lost here for the country is such a desolate waste of sameness, battered trenches, shell holes, mud and slush.  The firing line is not one long continuous trench but isolated positions here and there; there are places 100 yards wide [gaps in the line] where there are no men at all and I guess we wandered through one of these.  After about an hours going our guide admitted that he had lost his bearings and none of us had any idea of where we were except that Baupaume looked nearer than it should have been. While we were arguing the point one of the chaps went through the belongings of a dead “Tommie” nearby and we wondered at the time how it was he had been left so long [for bodies are generally searched for personal effects].  Anyway we decided to go back and accordingly did so, making a flanking movement and we received rather a shock when, after retiring about 200 yards we stumbled into our own firing line.  It was then about 4 p.m. and fairly light and we had been careering about “No Mans Land” as if we owned it without being molested except for one solitary rifle shot which, at the time, we took no notice of.  Fritz would have been pleased had we strolled into his line with the rations, consisting of hot tea, rum, bread, boiled meat, bacon, cheese, butter and jam.  This sort of thing has happened before – only a few days ago a German fatigue loaded with timber lost its way and came into our line thinking it their own.  They were promptly captured and the timber was used for our trenches.  The leader of the party was shot for refusing to halt – the remainder gave in quietly.  That little trip of ours is, I think dear Mother, the nearest I have been to being made a prisoner of war – we can laugh over it now but didn’t that guide of ours get a hot time.  Little incidents like this you know break the monotony of things.  Another three nights here will finish our fourth turn on the Somme and we expect to have a fairly decent rest somewhere in France.  So far the winter has not been as severe as we expected but there are still a couple of bad months to get through.
            Steady on, dear Mother, with your description of things so nice, green trees, flowers, birds nests, etc., you will make me homesick – would you like a description of things round here?  Mud, slush, shell holes, dud shells, bodies of men and horses – battered war material, stumps of trees and mud again.
            At present I am in a nice [sometimes] isolated position with three others – we have a dug-out and about 10 yards of trench.  No one can come near us in daylight [which is a good thing] and we cannot show ourselves above the trench. Each night 24 hours rations are brought to us and the officer looks in before daylight each morning to see that all is well.  We mount our guns at dusk, keep watch all night and take it down at dawn.  We have a lovely “field of fire” and will surprise Fritz if he attacks – ours is a waiting game.  Our dug-out, like all German built ones, is deep and dark and our only trouble is the lighting arrangements.  Candles are worth their weight in gold – we have to render down fat to make slush lamps.  I have two candles in reserve but they must be kept for use in case of trouble with our friend the “enemy”.  I will not be able to get this letter away for a day or two dear Mother so will leave it open and add more later – it is now 1 p.m. of Jan. 3rd and we are about to have dinner.  Au revoir, Love to all – Ray.
            <br><br>Flers, Jan 5th 1917, Midday.
            <br>Dear Mother,
            Last night I was relieved by another chap in our section and am now back in a cellar dug-out in Flers.  I had expected to be in the line a little longer but the officer thought 3 days quite enough.  The tramp back to here through the mud was awful and I hope it’s the last time I have to do it.  I had a good sleep last night and all this morning have been busy washing and shaving and trying to clean myself.  I note the address enclosed with your last letter but as you will know it arrived too late, my furlough is over.  Last night I received a nice letter from one Olive Godbert of the address you sent, saying they had heard from Mrs. Duckworth and would be pleased to see me at any time.  She was afraid I would think her very unladylike in writing to a strange boy.  I will answer her letter tonight.  I also had a letter from Beryl referring to the Godberts, I would like to meet them – someday I may get a chance. 
            Thanks dear Mother for the missing page of your previous letter.  I thought you had left one out for it ended so abruptly.  In case you do not get my last letter I must mention that I received the home parcel alright – it was great, thank you one and all for all the good things.  There is nothing more to tell just now dear mother so I will wind up and get this letter away.  I hope all of you are in good health.  Tons of love and many kisses from,
            <br>Your loving son,
            <br>Ray.

              Just a few lines now, I will write again later.  I am doing well but managed to stop a piece of shell a couple of days ago – my right arm this time, but still I am able to write so it is not too bad.  I consider myself lucky to have got out so lightly for the fighting was hot while it lasted and I had visions of Berlin – as a prisoner – we were nearly surrounded by Huns.

            Dear Mother,<br>
            Cheers!  How are you all?  It is so wet and miserable outside and here am I quite comfortable in bed in Hospital – lucky am I not.  Just tell Mag I was knocked again and this time on her birthday Oct 4th.  A nasty wound too, for until this last day or two I have not been able to take interest in anything – but I believe the worst is over though it will be a long time before I am right again.  I have just written to ask Jack Baker to send you a cable and hope you will not be worrying too much for I am going to be quite alright  and also I am going to keep out of the line as long as possible, for I firmly believe Fritz is trying hard to kill me.
            Just before we went into the line this time I had a letter from you but now I cannot remember the number or much about it, there were also some photographs from Alice, the date, I think, was about the end of July. I will write for my personal things to be sent from the Coy. to Uncle John’s for I will probably be sent to England shortly.  My wound is in the back and penetrated the chest, broke a rib and a piece of metal is still in.  My arm is a bit stiff so don’t mind this awful scrawl.  I think it would be a good scheme if you addressed all my mail c/o Uncle John, they always know where I am and would forward it on – I hope to make this wound last through the winter if possible, I guess I need a spell now, my record is good.
            How are all at home, in the best of health, I hope.  Doris looks well as a nurse, quite fat.  I wish she was here to look after me.  According to Alices’ photos there’s nothing wrong with her.  I would so much like to see you all again – that time may yet come, it most certainly will, I must try and work my nut.
            You told me of Herb’s new work, was it Mt. Morgan, I hope he does well, gets married and settles down.  I would like to settle down mother dear and look after you.  There is nothing more I can write just now – when I am convalescent perhaps I will make up all my correspondence.
            <br>14th. Oct.  Sunday.
            <br>A beautiful Sunday, the door open at my head and sunshine streaming over me.  But I am tired of bed already, yet there is much more of it.  Au revoir, dear mother, my best love to you and all at home – don’t be anxious,
            <br>Your loving son,

            Dear Mother,<br>
            I am still at the above address and keeping in the best of health.  The weather has been ideal for this time of the year but yesterday and today have been bitterly cold – the ground is frozen hard and it is very hard to keep warm.  Each hut is provided with a fire but the thirty men of the hut cannot all get round it.  There are fire buckets full of water in the huts and about 3 inches (about 75 cm.) of ice has formed on the top, so you will see it is fairly cold.  The camp is not too bad except that there is so much moving about.  I have been in three different camps and four different huts – just begin to know the chaps when you are lobbed into another crowd.
            Yesterday I was again up for medical examination and the doctor passed me as B.I.A.3., a step nearer to fitness and active service.  There are generally seven or eight hundred on these parades and four doctors examining so not much time is lost, the men are lost through like sheep.  But even if I get marked fit for Active Service next week I will first have to go to the Overseas Training Battalion and then to the Machine Gun Depôt  at Grantham – so it will still be a long time before I get sent to France.  I have met many old pals that I knew in France and Gallipoli at this Depôt,  among them being Ted Teitzel who was sworn in with me in Gympie.  He was wounded in the left hand in July 1916 and now is unfit for active service.  He was married over twelve months ago  in England , is  now the father of  a baby girl 10 weeks old.  Several others I have met are either married or going to be.  I wonder what the girls in Australia will be thinking of it all, but perhaps it is quite natural in men that have been away three years or more.
            Much of my Australian mail has, I think, gone astray but I may get it yet.  The last I have had was your Sept. letters, some of the fellows here have received  them of Nov. date.  I had a letter from Geo. Jamieson a few days ago, he is at Weymouth and doing well, he says his last mail from Aussie left all friends in Gympie in good health.  I think I spoke of having my photo taken in London in another letter to you.  So far I have not received them although I was to have them in ten days – they were post cards only.  I hope they come so that I may send some to you at home.
            Since coming here I have done no parades at all, just sit round the fire or go for long walks and sometimes find a cosy corner in which to write letters.  There is always a good fire in the reading room of the Sergeants Mess but like most other places where a fire is burning it is generally crowded.  There are many huts about the camp for soldiers to read, write or get refreshments at such as Y.M.C.A., C. of E.,  S. A.,  Home Hut, etc., also wet and dry canteens.  In the little old world of Sutton Veny there are a few places of entertainment, pictures and vaudeville and a few miles away is the town of Warminster, in bounds for the troops, hotels, shops, theatres.
            We are fairly in for wintry weather now, the wind howls outside like fury and sitting here in the hut I hardly know whether I have any feet or not.  I certainly cannot feel any warmth from the fire which is surrounded by a dozen other sergeants.  Oh! for a little Queensland weather now, it would be very acceptable.  I would like to know dear Mum this very minute how you are all getting on at home, are you swearing at the heat?  I don’t think I ever will again.  I am cured of a great many things now, why, I even ate a little beetroot the other day, it is rotten stuff and I won’t eat any more.
            Well dearest Mother mine, I really must quit now. Keep well won’t you?  Give my love to the girls and Herb and Olga and the relations in Gympie.  This blooming war must come to an end some day and all will be well.  Hooray Mum, best of love always and many kisses,
            <br>Your loving son,
            <br>Ray.

            <p>Mother Dear,<br>
              Nellie is at work – another girl is away from the office so Nellie could not get off so at present I am alone here in the front room before the fire – resting after a good dinner 2 p.m..  Tis a lovely day outside, a cloudless sky, warm sunshine and windy.  My leave started Tuesday morning, I left Sutton Veny Camp by motor and entrained at 8.20 a.m. at Warminster.  Owing to the food shortage each man is allowed to take his ration – sugar 8oz. (=8 ounces =230g.), Tea  2oz.,  Bacon  8ozs. Meat  11/2lb (=1.5 pounds, = .68 kg.), Bread  56oz. (1.58 kg.), - for 4 days.  I took the lot and handed them over to Cousin Annie.
              A Sgt. Major and I travelled together, the train was a fast one and we got to Paddington at 11 o’clock, dined at a restaurant and went by tube to London Bridge – left our Kits there while we walked about a bit – I met Nellie at London Bridge after she left the office and we went home together.  Had a late breakfast next morning and a walk round Sutton with Uncle John and little Sonny Turner nearly 5 years old – a good kiddy.  At 4.30 I met Nellie at the station.  Thursday I had breakfast with Nellie and went to London seeing her safely to the office.  Then I walked across London Bridge and through the city – got tired and dived down a tube, bought a ticket for 2 d. (=2 pence = 1 cent.) to take me to Victoria Station.  Had to change at Leicester Square – got on the wrong train, changed to another one and found myself back at Leicester Sq. again.  Then found the right one and lobbed out into daylight per moving staircase at Victoria.  Walked to A.I.F. Headquarters, nothing doing there so walked about Westminster for a while – ordered some more photos.  Then I walked to the fashionable quarter, Pall Mall, Regent St., etc. and enjoyed sightseeing.  Too many officers about, got tired of saluting so sought refuge in the good old tube and after changing once or twice arrived at Paddington and made enquiries re trains back to camp.  Took to the tube again and eventually saw light at Charing Cross.  Strolled along the Strand and dined at Y.M.C.A. Aldwich.  Then had a bus ride to London Bridge, strolled about the city in that vicinity, paid 2 d. for a wash and brush up, had two cups of tea and sandwiches at a refreshment bar.  Later on had a shave and boots cleaned and finally met Nellie at the office at 5 p.m..
              So to date that is how my leave has been spent.  I had a letter from Ed Router just before coming on leave, in answer to mine, he expected to be transferred to the Overseas Training Battalion near Sutton Veny yesterday – perhaps I will see him when I go back – he has had a bundle of mail from Aussie and was “as happy as a King”, his own expression.
              I hope to be able to write again soon, will close now Mother dear, best of love always to you and all at home,
              <br>Your loving son,
              <br>Ray.</p>

          <article class="letter">
            <p>My Dear Mother,<br>
              All your letters are coming to me by degrees – a few days ago I received Nos. 33 and 37, the latter dated Jan 18th to 24th ,  not too long coming, was it?  I was awfully glad to get them also Dot’s letter which was a very newsy one but was late in reaching me – it was of Nov. date still so very welcome.
              Now I must tell you of my movements from the O.T.B. to Grantham.  With many other Machine Gunners I had to rise at 4.45 a.m. last Monday to proceed from O.T.B., Longbridge Deverill, Wiltshire to the Australian M. G. training base at Grantham.  We had breakfast at 5.15, reported at 6 o’clock and marched out of camp at 6.30 a.m., reached Warminster and caught the 8.21 train.  Changed trains at Westbury and arrived at Paddington about 11.10 a.m..  Our kits were loaded on a motor van and we [7 NCO’s and 40 men] went by tube to Kings Cross Station.  The train was to leave for Grantham at 1.35 so we were let loose to have a look around and get some dinner.
              I did some very hard thinking while partaking of tea and pie at the Y.M.C.A.. It was the call of love versus duty, whether  to go on to Grantham or break away and go to see Nellie. Love won.  I went on the platform, got my equipment and kit bags, placed them in the cloak room and quietly strolled to the Underground and in a few minutes was well out of the way at London Bridge Station.  I got on the phone [Hop 1121] the office where Nellie works and was soon in conversation with her.  She was busy but arranged to leave the office at 4 p.m. instead of 5.—and I was to meet her there.
              At one of the many handy places in London I had a shave, wash and boots cleaned also lunch and went for a walk about the Big Smoke,  Charing Cross, Strand, Thames Embankment, etc. feeling quite a free man and wondering if I had been missed at Kings Cross – But I did not worry about that much and at the appointed time met Nellie at the office door.  We hopped off to London Bridge Station, caught the 4.15 p.m. train and eventually lobbed out at Sutton Station.  We walked down the old familiar street [High St.], bought a cake for tea and went home – to the surprise and pleasure of Uncle John and Nellie’s mother.
              I had a chat with Uncle John for a while then went downstairs to find a nice fire going in our room (not a bedroom in those days – possibly a front parlour not otherwise used – D.B.) – and then a flickering fire, a cosy chair and each other.  Somewhere about 7 p.m. our tea was brought to us nicely laid out on a tray, they are so kind to us always.  The next break was supper about ten o’clock and a delightful evening came to an end at 11.30 p.m..  I retired for the night fully satisfied that I had done the right thing in breaking away from the draft.
              In the morning I had breakfast with Nellie, said goodbye to my good kinsfolk and went up to London with my sweetheart.  I had to part from Nellie at the office – we stood together on the footpath and the crowded thoroughfare did not prevent us from indulging in the proper leave taking of an engaged couple.
              It was rather hard, Mother dear, to part from Nellie, not knowing when I would see her again.  I went to the nearest tube station and in a few minutes saw daylight again at Kings Cross and I wondered how I would get to Grantham without a pass or a ticket.  I spotted an inspector of the railway and planted myself in front of him – told him my tale and dropped a few shillings in his hand.  It worked like magic, my troubles were over.  A train was in that was to leave at 10 a.m.. I got my gear from the cloakroom, the inspector found me a seat, he brought the ticket collector along  and squared him not to ask me for a ticket and also to help me out of the train at Grantham.  It was a non-stop run, we cut out the hundred and odd miles in a little over two hours and as soon as the train stopped at Grantham the collector bloke had my kit out on the platform.  He spoke to a porter and asked him to let me pass the barrier.  The porter passed me out alright and saw me safely into a motor car.  Three miles to camp, I did it in state and arrived in time for a good dinner at the Sergeants Mess.
              I fell in amongst friends, within about half an hour I had met about a dozen old pals of the good old 3rd. M. G. Coy., men I had fought side by side with in France at Fleurbaix, Pozieres, Bullecourt, Ypres, etc. etc..  After dinner I reported myself – “Ah, the missing sergeant has arrived, Where have you been? etc..”   I said,  “Oh! I’ve just arrived from the O.T.B. via London, missed the train yesterday.”   Nothing more was said, they took my particulars: number, name, rank, unit, etc. and told me to report at ‘C’ Coy.  Orderly Room which I did and all was well.
              In the afternoon I went before the Doctor for inspection and was marked A.3. which means here – almost fit, requires hardening.  My medical history sheet was missing and the Doctor said he would see me again when it turned up – he wanted to know particulars of wound and treatment.  I was issued with five blankets and matress and given a room with another Sergeant – cosy and private.
              This morning I passed dental inspection as OK and reported at Coy. O.R. for duty.  The Coy. Officer was going to give me a good job as Orderly Sgt. but the Camp Adjutant bounced in and said he wanted me to go to a school for a course of instruction for 5 or 6 weeks – so I received orders to march out to this school a couple of miles from the Aus. Camp and quite close to Grantham town.
              So here I am, Mother dear and tomorrow will start work in earnest.  That is all I can write just now, I have to go to bed.  Good-night dear Mum, my best love to you and all at home, I do hope you are keeping well, I am pretty good myself, so is Nellie and all Sutton – they send their love to you.  Good night, sweet dreams and may I be able to see you soon,
              <br>Your loving son,
              <br>Ray.</p>

          <article class="letter">
            <p>Dear Mother,<br>
              I have received your letters 39 and 40, need I say they were very welcome? I am always so pleased to get mail from you and all the home news in your last letter was all the more welcome because I know now you have the news of my engagement to Nellie and your loving messages assure me of your approval. Your place in my heart, dear Mother mine is ever firmly fixed, do not think it could be otherwise, I know full well my own Mother’s worth.  And Nellie loves you too for my sake and from all I have told her of you.  She received your letter about the same time as I got mine from you and she wrote to me at once about it.  I think I will send you the letter, it happens to be only a short one and I know you will keep It very private. 
              The day I received this letter from Nellie I managed to get four days leave.  My pass was given me at ten minutes past three p.m.  A train for London was to leave Grantham at 3.37 and I had 8 miles to go – but I caught it with 5 min. to spare.  I needed a shave and wash but had no time – I caught a motor car at 3.20, glad to be off for I had four days before me and Nellie waiting at the other end.  In London I had time for a wash and a shave at London Bridge Station before catching the 7.40 p.m. train for Sutton and I was home before 9 o’clock giving Nellie quite a surprise as she did not expect me and I had no time to wire.
              I found them all well and pleased to see me.  At midnight I went to bed, tired but happy.  Nellie had to go to the office in the morning [Saturday] for half a day so I went to London with her.  Then I went to A.I.F. headquarters to draw a pound or two for myself and found out that my medal was there but I will have to apply for it through Hd. Quarters at this camp and be presented with it in the proper manner.
              At a Y.M.C.A. I had some light refreshment, walked about London a bit, fixed myself up with a soft collar and tie, bought half a dozen lovely red roses for Nellie [she loves flowers] and I met her at the office about 10 to 1 p.m..  We went home together and all was well – a long walk after tea [Surrey is lovely in the spring] and a quiet evening at home.  Sunday was a dull day, raining and cold so we kept in doors and the weather did not trouble us, we had a cosy room and flickering fire. 
              Monday the weather had improved so Nellie and I went for a walk in the morning through the old world village of Cheam and Nonesuch Park.  We got away from houses altogether and strolled between fine hedges, fields of green and wild flowers, blossoming trees full of sweet singing birds.  Home all the afternoon and went to the pictures at night.  Tuesday – shopping with Nellie in the morning and home the remainder of the day – a most glorious day – but it was hard having to go away by the 8.58 p.m. train.  Nellie came to the station with me and so I was rushed away into the night while Nellie had to go away by herself in the opposite direction.   I was due back at Camp at midmight and reached there just two hours late but that was nothing. I had to walk the 3 miles from Grantham Station.
              I am not doing a great deal of work here but anyway I don’t want to.  My health is keeping good, the doctor marked me A.3. and will see me again sometime.  Thanks Mum for enclosing Mrs. Patterson’s letter, I hope she is now keeping quite alright, you will know if you got my other letter that I wrote to them some time ago.  Mr. Bardwell’s paper was interesting, I believe I would like him very much from all you have told me – and his wife too.  Just like Al isn’t it to go and have a good holiday and then get sick after coming home. I was glad to hear she did have a good holiday in spite of the weather.  And the brat seems to have been having a good time at Redcliffe – I had her letter written from there and Nellie showed me the one she got – and your letter to Nellie I read also.
              Young Jack Baker wrote and told me he had received Doris’s letter and was pleased to get it.  Uncle John showed me the Gympie paper you sent and always asks me to send you all his best wishes.  He is a bonsor old chap, so full of life and happy, very healthy looking too.  All at that home at Sutton live quietly and happily together and I always receive the best of welcomes from them.
              Tell Tom W. I received his letter and photo alright and the other letter of congratulations and good wishes. I will write to him soon, my best wishes to himself and family.
              Well Mother dear, I have not time to write much more just now but another letter will follow shortly.  I hope all is well at home, that the girls keep in good health and you too mum.  My love to Olga and Herb and I trust they have settled down to a happy and prosperous married life.  Best of love to all the sisters and to you, from,
              <br>Your loving son,
              <br>Ray.
